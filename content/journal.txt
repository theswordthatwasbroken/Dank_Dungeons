12th of Winter 1203
Nothing much has happened since I left the courier's office in Fairweather, around 4 days ago. Carrying a few packages, destination Stonemarch: port city and trading center of the area.
One package is addressed to the owner of the Happy Dragon in the Poor District. The other is for someone I met once: Sir Adhalla benLuran, now the chief armorer for the Merchant-Prince
in Stonemarch.

By the blessed feet of Zentar! My horse has been stolen while I was sleeping. It will take around two weeks to walk to Stonewall. Last time I was out this way, Gregor's Fyne Drynks-
about a day and a half's walk from here towards Stonemarch- had a few horses. Maybe I can buy one from the owner. Looks like I'll be late with those packages.

The outer edge of a forest. Gregor's Fyne Drynks is a couple of hours walk from here.
